# QMMC 2026

The Advanced School on Quantum Modelling of Materials with CRYSTAL - QMMC 2026 
provides an in-depth exploration of the theoretical and practical aspects of 
simulating material properties using quantum mechanics. The event will be held 
in Volta Redonda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil at the Federal Fluminense University 
(UFF - Aterrado campus) from January 26 to 29, 2026. The school is primarily 
aimed at early-stage researchers (postdoctoral researchers, PhD candidates, 
MSc/undergraduate students), with a limited number of attendees.
